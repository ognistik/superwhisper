      "input" : "This is the script of my video, I need the description:\nHey everyone! My name is Robert. In this channel, I've shared a lot about applications, workflows, and ways to customize your system. But at its core, all of this connects to creativity - whether it's finding clever solutions for automation or developing better ways to think and work. But another side of creativity that I personally enjoy as much and actually do find much more meaningful has to do with creative expression.\n\nI don't mention it a lot, but for many years I worked in lots of video projects. I focused primarily in wedding filmmaking, but also some documentary work, commercial work and other projects. Throughout this journey, though, what probably taught me the most was the world of weddings. Particularly trying to rebel against the traditional formulas. You know, those typical beautiful shots with emotional music, and moving words or speeches that you've seen and heard a thousand times. Breaking away from these conventions led me to explore cinema language, and one of those areas that changed everything for me was learning about the incredible power of sound design.\n\nI've just put together an introduction class on Skillshare that explores this creative side of audio in filmmaking. This is not about weddings by the way, though you can use this knowledge in any kind of video project. It's just about understanding how we can use sound to enhance reality and go beyond what is being captured by the camera. All of this with the purpose of comunicating our ideas more effectively and create more engaging work. \n\nBy the way, I do not mention this in the class, but one of my secret weapons for Sound Design is this application called called Soundly. It's an ever-growing library of high quality sounds that is just amazing. I still think it's no replacement to recording your own audio and learning through experimentation, but if you work in videos that need a little extra in the sound department... you won't be disappointed. I am not affiliated to the app in any way, I just think it's pretty incredible.\n\nMany people who know me through my other video work have been asking me to create more content related to this. This class is just attempt to share some practical insights into my creative process in a way that's accessible and immediately useful. If this resonates with you and is helpful, just let me know. Your feedback will help me understand if this is something you'd like to see more of. If there's some demand for it I'd be happy to create other short, focused classes like this one. There's so much more to explore.\n\nYou can check out the full class on Skillshare, I will give you the link in the description if you access it during the trial you can actually watch it for free. If you decide to stay on that platform and use my link to sign up, your subscription really helps support this channel. I'll leave you with the trailer and I'll talk to you soon.",
      "output" : "Hey guys! I want to share with you about a new Skillshare class! It's an introduction class on Sound Design for anyone interested in filmmaking or video work. I'm trying to approach this from a creative standpoint rather than technicalities. Actually, students can take the class and do the project I propose in there even with just their phone :)\n\nFor many years, I've worked in wedding filmmaking and other video projects. Understanding cinema language and the power of audio as a communication tool really transformed my work. \n\nThis class comes from many requests to share more about filmmaking. It's actually quite challenging for me to share about this topic—it's very personal to me, and I worry about making it too technical or formulaic when it's really not that way at all. In video\/filmmaking work, especially once you understand audio and it's role in the cinema language, can be so much about having creative ideas and sharing them clearly. I hope this hands-on approach will be useful to some and maybe even inspiring. Let's see how it goes, and I might share more about this later.\n\nI mention Soundly in this video. An incredible app with a lot of high quality sound recordings and effects:\n[LINK]\n\nTake the class here:\n[LINK]\n\nStay updated with my weekly insights and tips:\nhttps:\/\/afadingthought.substack.com\/\n\nIf this content was helpful to you, I hope you can consider buying me a coffee:\nhttps:\/\/buymeacoffee.com\/afadingthought"
