And it's just inspired. And the notes are coming. He has no idea where they're coming from, but the audience is just loving it. They're screaming, they're cheering, they're clapping. When he's done, the audience is just falling away. They'd never heard anything like that. And Charles Mingus, his boss, the bassist, calls him over and tells him, John, don't ever do that again. Now what's going on there? Now what John Handy said, his immediate reaction was, boss is jealous of me I just did something that was so exciting that I became the center of attention and now he doesn't want me to Do that but he said it only occurred to him later what Charles Mingus really meant what he really said was you had a moment of inspiration there where you did something you were totally The moment. Don't try to play that exact same thing tomorrow night.\n\n*David Perell*\nHuh.\n\n*Ted Gioia*\nNow I see what you're saying. You got this idea. And now tomorrow night, instead of being fresh and open to the experience, and in the moment again, you're going to try to recreate what you did 24 hours ago or a week ago or a month ago or A year ago. So when he told John Heddy, don't do that again, he wasn't saying, I'm jealous of you because you did something great. He says, I want you to do great things again in the future. But the only way you can do that is being open to the immediacy of the experience right there.\n<\/example-input-1>\n<example-output-1>\nAfter I played an inspired sax solo with Charles Mingus that drove the crowd wild, my boss told me \"don't ever do that again,\" and I initially thought he was jealous. Later I realized **the real lesson was to stay present and not chase yesterday's magic**, because if I tried to recreate that exact solo tomorrow, I'd lose the freshness and spontaneity that made it special; **the only way to do great things again is to stay open to each moment** rather than trying to repeat past successes.\n<\/example-output-1>\n\n<example-input-2>\n*Ted Gioia*\nI got this idea of just trusting the spontaneity and not try to force anything and to let it come to me. That's helped me enormously as a writer. And so now I do this almost as an extreme i will write things and some of the stuff i write is pretty strange i mean if you read my newsletter it's unusual but this is the only way i know how To work is is to let myself take chances that's the only way i can get up to that level you know i have to if i just tried to do it by rote and routine and formula, I could get up there maybe consistently. But if I want to get up to that higher level, I've got to take risks. And this is how I do it.\n<\/example-input-2>\n<example-output-2>\nI've learned to trust spontaneity and let ideas come naturally rather than forcing them, which has helped me enormously as a writer, even when what I produce seems strange or unusual. **Taking risks is the only way I can reach a higher level**, because while routine and formula might make me consistent, **trusting spontaneity and taking chances is how I do my best work** and push beyond what's predictable.\n<\/example-output-2>\n\n<example-input-3>\n*Ted Gioia*\nLet's look at the theory of evolution, okay? Okay. And supposedly according to the theory of evolution, people get better and better all the time. But in fact, what evolution has done is not taught us to be honest, but taught us to fit in. Because the survival of the fittest is the person who fits in. Like if you're a child and your family moves, you go to a new school, and you're thrown with all these other kids, what's your goal? Well, I want to fit in. You're drafted into the army. You're with all these soldiers. Well, I want to fit in. I don't want to make waves. This is how you succeed in the world. So there's this evolutionary tendency for people have to choose being honest or saying what will help them fit in. People are rewarded for fitting in. So this is why we have groupthink. This is why we have formulas.\n\n*David Perell*\nAnd there's a Girardian component with imitation. Absolutely.\n\n*Ted Gioia*\nYou know, Peter, you were absolutely, Renee Girard said, there's a tendency for people to imitate. And this has been programmed into us biologically because we survive if we fit in. Now, I'm going back to writing now. And this writing advice I just gave, this is why you need to unteach yourself everything you've done to fit in and be part of the group thing. You have to give yourself permission to be honest because society will not give you that permission. 99% of the situations you are in in society will reward you for adapting to other people's expectations. And that doesn't create greatness as a writer. So the only way you can get to this higher level as a writer is you must give yourself permission to go against the evolutionary tendency, the need to fit in, the groupthink, the Girardian Mimetic thing of imitation, and speak honestly from your heart.\n<\/example-input-3>\n<example-output-3>\nEvolution has taught us to fit in rather than be honest, because survival rewards those who adapt and avoid making waves, which is why we develop groupthink and follow formulas from school to work. As a writer, though, **I have to unteach everything I've learned about fitting in**, because society rewards conformity 99% of the time and won't give me permission to be honest. **The only way to reach greatness is to give myself permission to speak honestly from my heart**, even when it goes against the evolutionary pull to imitate and conform to others' expectations.\n<\/example-output-3>\n<\/examples>\n\n<important-notes>\n* Always preserve the original meaning and perspective\n* If you see speaker names, ignore them and write in first person\n* **Bold only complete thoughts that stand alone as full ideas**\n* Think: \"If someone reads ONLY the bold parts, do they get complete, meaningful statements?\"\n* Each bold section should be a self-contained phrase that captures a core insight\n* When in doubt, bold less rather than more, and always bold complete phrases\n* No need to mention the names of the speakers if there's any given\n<\/important-notes>",
